Cloud Client desktop</h3>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>Features</b></p>
<ol>
	<li><p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
	Real-time synchronization of folders with the remote Cloud</p></li>
	<li><p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
	Daily backup (the PC requires an additional HD to prevent disk
	failure from also causing the loss of the backup)</p></li>
	<li><p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
	Backup for versioning (occurs automatically when a file is modified,
	the backup is created on the additional HD)</p></li>
	<li><p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
	Creation of digital identity, digital signature of PDF documents and
	signature validation.</p></li>
	<li><p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
	Mirroring on a network path. The Cloud path can be maintained in
	real-time copy on a network path in a similar way to a RAID 1
	system, with the difference that mirroring, being on the network,
	protects the company against data loss due to computer theft.</p></li>
	<li><p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
	Decentralized account: Saving and recovering the account via
	passphrase, with technology derived from Bitcoin wallets.</p></li>
	<li><p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
	Encrypted stealth partition: To prevent access to the local cloud
	area via a password (we have developed a system of derived keys to
	protect against quantum computer attacks)</p></li>
	<li><p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
	Use virtualized applications to work on files without leaving traces
	on your computer: Every time we use our computer to work on files,
	we leave traces: Temporary files, data on disk tracks, list of
	recent files that the editor has worked on, etc.. with this
	technology no trace is left</p></li>
</ol>
<h3 class="western">Private Cloud home consumer</h3>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Device
for remote file synchronization, creates a system similar to OneDrive
or DropBox but private, that is, the data is not in the hands of
third-party companies, but stored on your device in which it is
connected to the client with military-grade encryption via 2 possible
protocols: Encrypted Socket, or our Rest API implementation to which
a level of encryption has been added to the HTML request that is not
present in the standard protocol.</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">You
can connect to the Cloud via:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
	<span lang="en-US">Desktop application that synchronizes in real
	time</span></p></li>
	<li><p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
	<span lang="en-US">Mobile application that consists of a file
	explorer that allows you to save and download files in the Cloud</span></p></li>
	<li><p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
	<span lang="en-US">Static web page (file explorer for the browser,
	with “drag &amp; drop” functions for managing files in the
	cloud).</span></p></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="western">Cloud enterprise</h3>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><span lang="en-US">This
is a stand-alone Cloud, with an operating system and installed on a
dedicated server, with scalability functions dedicated to companies.
In particular:</span></p>
<ol>
	<li><p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
	<span lang="en-US">It is possible to create and mount on the fly
	from 0 to N Clouds (with the limit of the disk unit space).</span></p></li>
	<li><p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
	<span lang="en-US">Create on the fly area sub-Clouds, for example,
	if a company has different departments within it (marketing,
	research and development, commercial and sales), it is possible to
	create for each department a Cloud positioned in a branch of the
	main Cloud so that the members of the department are limited to a
	restricted area with respect to the main Cloud, while the company
	management has access via the connection to the main Cloud located
	at the root. The sub-Clouds in turn can have sub-Clouds to create
	restricted work areas.</span></p></li>
	<li><p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
	<span lang="en-US">Daily data backup function.</span></p></li>
	<li><p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
	<span lang="en-US">It is possible to parring two enterprise clouds
	located in different geographical locations (for example Europe and
	the USA): In this case the paired Clouds will have the same data
	synchronized in real time: Useful function for disaster recovery in
	case the company where the cloud is stored is destroyed by a flood
	or fire that would physically destroy the server and all the backup
	copies within the company.</span></p></li>
	<li><p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
	<span lang="en-US">Data mirroring on a network path.</span></p></li>
	<li><p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
	<span lang="en-US">On-the-fly creation of disposable PINs to access
	the Cloud: The generated PIN allows the creation of a digital
	identity to connect to the Cloud, to which the network administrator
	assigns a name. The owner of the digital identity can export it to
	another machine via a passphrase (similarly to what happens with
	Bitcoin wallets, the underlying technology is the same).</span></p></li>
	<li><p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
	<span lang="en-US">Advanced self-diagnostics and problem-solving
	functions: The enterprise Cloud requires a system administrator for
	commissioning, maintenance and assistance: Since the infrastructure
	can have different configuration models, the Cloud already has all
	the self-diagnostic tests inside it to identify all types of
	problems that could arise due to the configuration of the
	infrastructure.</span></p></li>
</ol>
<h3 class="western">Encrypted proxy</h3>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><span lang="en-US">It
is a proprietary implementation of a proxy system that supports a
level of encryption for which the proxy does not become trustless:
Unlike a traditional proxy or VPN, the data transits natively
encrypted and continues encrypted to the cloud without the machine on
which the proxy is installed being able to see the transmission in
clear. In a traditional VPN, the data is encrypted up to the machine
that acts as a VPN and from there on it still travels in clear.</span></p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><span lang="en-US">The
idea is to keep the entire Cloud infrastructure within a company
intranet, without it being directly exposed to the outside (to the
Internet), and expose only the proxy which thus acts as a secure
machine as a trustless gateway for data traffic coming from abroad
and therefore allows the connection of clients to the infrastructure
with a high level of security.</span></p>
<h3 class="western">Messaging Router</h3>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><span lang="en-US">The
messaging router is a logical machine that allows you to manage data
traffic in a trustless manner (all traffic is encrypted from source
to destination and the router has no way of seeing the traffic
passing through in clear text). The router also allows you to route
messages to logical groups of machines, devices on a precarious
mobile network, and to devices with dynamic IP. It was created to
manage communications for applications equivalent to Telegram, or
Signal. A single machine can manage hundreds of thousands of client
devices and the traffic they generate. The ability to also manage
binary-level packets (in addition to audio, text, images) has made it
the cornerstone tool for connecting clients and servers and routing
the traffic generated in any condition.</span></p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><span lang="en-US">The
Router can work in symbiosis with the encrypted Proxy since the
latter is a client device for the router.</span></p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><span lang="en-US">At
a logical level, it is possible to customize any infrastructure by
placing more than one router and proxy inside based on the
infrastructure needs. The Cloud enterprise solution in the same
machine combines Cloud server, Router and Proxy in order to have a
ready-made solution, but ad hoc solutions are possible to adapt to
different projects and customized corporate security policies.</span></p>
<h3 class="western">Telemetry data acquisition</h3>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><span lang="en-US">We
have created low-level libraries that can be integrated on small
low-cost ARM devices (~20€), to connect the Internet of Things to
the router or to acquire the flow of telemetry data from industrial
equipment.</span></p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><span lang="en-US">The
telemetry data is encrypted and routed in real time to any type of
device or logical group, such as to the Cloud, to mobile devices, to
other devices, even with precarious connection conditions, or dynamic
IP, and even through different types of connection (TCP, radio, GSM,
RS232, etc.), an internal spooler will take care of getting the data
to its destination regardless of the quality of the network and
presence of connection at the time of acquisition.</span></p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><span lang="en-US">The
security level adopted, as regards the privacy of communication, is
military-grade.</span></p>
